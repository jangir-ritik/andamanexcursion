# Andaman Excursion Services Architecture Documentation

## 📁 Overview

Your `src/services/` folder contains **4 distinct service layers** that handle different aspects of your application. Here's the complete breakdown:

```
src/services/
├── api/                    # 🌐 CLIENT-SIDE API LAYER (Frontend HTTP calls)
├── payload/                # 🗄️ SERVER-SIDE PAYLOAD CMS LAYER (Direct DB access)
│   ├── base/              # Core utilities and query builders
│   ├── collections/       # Collection-specific services (cleaned up)
│   └── composed/          # High-level composed services (simplified)
├── ferryServices/          # 🚢 FERRY BOOKING BUSINESS LOGIC
├── notifications/          # 📧 NOTIFICATION SERVICES
├── contact-form-options.service.ts

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis

### 1. **`api/` Folder - Client-Side API Layer**

**Purpose**: Frontend HTTP API calls to your Next.js API routes
**Technology**: Fetch API, HTTP requests
**Usage**: React components, client-side code

```typescript
// Example: src/services/api/activities.ts
export const activityApi = {
  async search(params) {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/activities?action=search&${queryParams}`);
    return response.json();
  }
}
```

**Files**:
- `activities.ts` - Activity search/fetch via HTTP API
- `activityCategories.ts` - Category data via HTTP API  
- `boatRoutes.ts` - Boat route data via HTTP API
- `locations.ts` - Location data via HTTP API
- `timeSlots.ts` - Time slot data via HTTP API

**Key Characteristics**:
- ✅ **Client-side only** (runs in browser)
- ✅ Makes HTTP calls to `/api/*` routes
- ✅ Used by React components and hooks
- ✅ Handles loading states, errors, caching via React Query

### 2. **`payload/` Folder - Server-Side Payload CMS Layer**

**Purpose**: Direct database access using Payload CMS Local API
**Technology**: Payload CMS Local API, direct database queries
**Usage**: Server components, API routes, SSR/SSG

```typescript
// Example: src/services/payload/collections/activities.ts
export const activityService = {
  async getAll(): Promise<Activity[]> {
    const payload = await getCachedPayload();
    const result = await payload.find({
      collection: "activities",
      where: { "status.isActive": { equals: true } }
    });
    return result.docs;
  }
}
```

**Architecture**:
```
payload/
├── base/                   # Core utilities and query builders
│   ├── client.ts          # Payload instance with React cache
│   ├── queries.ts         # Generic query functions
│   └── utils.ts           # Helper utilities
├── collections/           # Collection-specific services
│   ├── activities.ts      # Activity CRUD operations
│   ├── blogs.ts          # Blog CRUD operations
│   ├── locations.ts      # Location CRUD operations
│   ├── packages.ts       # Package CRUD operations
│   ├── pages.ts          # Page CRUD operations
│   └── time-slots.ts     # Time slot CRUD operations
└── composed/             # High-level composed services
    ├── form-data-service.ts    # Form dropdown data
    ├── page-data-service.ts    # Complete page data
    └── search-service.ts       # Cross-collection search
```

**Key Characteristics**:
- ✅ **Server-side only** (Node.js environment)
- ✅ Direct database access via Payload Local API
- ✅ Used in API routes, server components, SSR/SSG
- ✅ React cache for performance optimization
- ✅ Type-safe with Payload generated types

### 3. **`ferryServices/` Folder - Ferry Booking Business Logic**

**Purpose**: Complex ferry booking logic with multiple operator APIs
**Technology**: External API integration, business logic orchestration
**Usage**: Ferry booking flow, API routes

```typescript
// Example: Ferry aggregation across multiple operators
const { results, errors } = await FerryAggregationService.searchAllOperators({
  from: "port-blair",
  to: "havelock", 
  date: "2024-12-20",
  adults: 2
});
```

**Architecture**:
- `ferryAggregationService.ts` - **Main orchestrator** (calls all operators)
- `sealinkService.ts` - Sealink/Nautika API integration
- `makruzzService.ts` - Makruzz API integration  
- `greenOceanService.ts` - Green Ocean API integration
- `ferryApiService.ts` - Utility layer (retry, timeout, error handling)
- `ferryBookingService.ts` - Booking creation and management
- `locationMappingService.ts` - Location mapping between operators

**Key Characteristics**:
- ✅ **Server-side business logic**
- ✅ Multiple external API integrations
- ✅ Complex orchestration and data transformation
- ✅ Caching, retry logic, error handling
- ✅ Unified interface for different ferry operators

## 🏗️ Payload CMS Architecture Explanation

You're correct about Payload v3 offering two consumption methods:

### **Method 1: REST API (HTTP)**
```typescript
// External API calls (what your api/ folder does)
fetch('/api/activities')  // HTTP request to Payload REST API
```

### **Method 2: Local API (Direct)**  
```typescript
// Direct database access (what your payload/ folder does)
const payload = await getPayload({ config });
const result = await payload.find({ collection: "activities" });
```

**Your Implementation**:
- ✅ **API folder**: Uses REST API approach (HTTP calls)
- ✅ **Payload folder**: Uses Local API approach (direct access)
- ✅ **Both are valid** for different use cases

## 🚀 Usage Guidelines

### **When to use API layer**:
```typescript
// In React components, hooks, client-side code
import { activityApi } from '@/services/api/activities';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data } = useQuery(['activities'], activityApi.getAll);
  return <div>{data.map(...)}</div>;
};
```

### **When to use Payload layer**:
```typescript
// In API routes, server components, SSR/SSG
import { activityService } from '@/services/payload/collections/activities';

export async function GET() {
  const activities = await activityService.getAll();
  return Response.json(activities);
}
```

### **When to use Ferry Services**:
```typescript
// In ferry-specific API routes, booking logic
import { FerryAggregationService } from '@/services/ferryServices/ferryAggregationService';

export async function POST(request) {
  const searchParams = await request.json();
  const { results, errors } = await FerryAggregationService.searchAllOperators(searchParams);
  return Response.json({ results, errors });
}
```
