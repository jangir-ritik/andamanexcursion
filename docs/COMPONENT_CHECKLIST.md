# Component Development Checklist

This document serves as a comprehensive checklist for developing components in our Andaman Excursion project. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, accessibility, and maintainability across the codebase.

## Component Structure

- [ ] Component follows atomic design principles (atom, molecule, organism, or section block)
- [ ] Component is placed in the appropriate directory based on its type
- [ ] Component has a clear, descriptive name that reflects its purpose
- [ ] Component has an index.ts file for clean exports
- [ ] Component has proper TypeScript types defined in the types directory
- [ ] Complex components have their content extracted to separate content files

## Styling

- [ ] Component uses CSS modules for styling
- [ ] Component uses CSS variables from variables.css for:
  - [ ] Colors
  - [ ] Font sizes and families
  - [ ] Spacing (margin, padding, gap)
  - [ ] Border radius
  - [ ] Box shadows
- [ ] No hardcoded values for colors, spacing, or typography
- [ ] Component is responsive with appropriate media queries
- [ ] Component follows the project's naming conventions for CSS classes

## Accessibility

- [ ] Semantic HTML elements are used appropriately
- [ ] ARIA attributes are provided where necessary (aria-label, aria-labelledby, etc.)
- [ ] Images have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy is maintained
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Focus states are visually apparent
- [ ] Decorative elements use aria-hidden="true"

## Performance

- [ ] Images use Next.js Image component with appropriate sizing
- [ ] Large images use priority loading for above-the-fold content
- [ ] Appropriate image formats are used (WebP, AVIF where supported)
- [ ] Components avoid unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Heavy components use appropriate loading strategies

## Code Quality

- [ ] Component props have proper TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Props have default values where appropriate
- [ ] Component has appropriate prop validation
- [ ] Component is properly documented with JSDoc comments
- [ ] No unused variables or imports
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Code follows project's formatting standards

## Reusability

- [ ] Component is designed to be reusable where appropriate
- [ ] Component accepts className prop for external styling
- [ ] Component has appropriate variants for different use cases
- [ ] Component logic is separated from presentation where possible

## Links and Navigation

- [ ] Links use the appropriate component (Button with href, InlineLink, or Next.js Link)
- [ ] External links have target="\_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer"
- [ ] Links have descriptive text and appropriate aria-labels

## Testing (Future Implementation)

- [ ] Component has unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Component has visual regression tests
- [ ] Component has accessibility tests

## Documentation

- [ ] Component has a README.md file explaining its purpose and usage
- [ ] Complex props are documented with examples
- [ ] Component variants are documented with examples

## Review Process

Before submitting a component for review, ensure:

1. The component meets all applicable checklist items
2. The component renders correctly across all supported screen sizes
3. The component works correctly in all supported browsers
4. The component has been manually tested for accessibility
5. The component follows the project's design system

## Enforcing the Checklist

To enforce this checklist:

1. Use this document as a reference during component development
2. Include a completed checklist in pull request descriptions
3. Review components against this checklist during code reviews
4. Consider implementing automated checks for critical items (e.g., linting for unused variables, accessibility testing)
5. Update this checklist as new best practices are identified

By following this checklist, we ensure that our components are high-quality, accessible, and maintainable.
